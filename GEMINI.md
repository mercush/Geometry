Read the docstrings in the files to understand what needs to be done in each file.

You are trying to build a system that queries a language model to write a conjecture in a custom DSL. 
Look closely at how this is done in ~/repos/cogsci/Lean/lean-experiments/mau/src/LeanEuclid/AutoFormalization/statement/autoformalize.py
and also look at the novel method we are trying to evaluate at ~/repos/cogsci/Lean/lean-experiments/mau/src/LeanPotential.
